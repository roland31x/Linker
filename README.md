# Two-Pass Linker simulator

There is an IO.Zip that contains example inputs and their actual outputs by a proper link program, for comparison to this one.

Edit the 'input' file inside the Linker folder and run the .exe to generate an output file in the .exe folder.

NOTE: the program only works if the 'input' is properly parsed for linking standards, otherwise it won't be able to read from the file properly.
